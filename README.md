# Vercel PWA Hosting
Project to understand the Vercel hosting service for static files.

### About the experience
> Surprising, much easier than I expected... The name Vercel made me worried, but deploying a REST app on Vercel's serverless service takes less than 3 minutes. Sign up with your GitHub account, select the repository, and boom... perfect.
>
> When I wrote this POC, I was with two people looking to learn JavaScript and PWA Foundation, so this code was worth teaching them both simultaneously.
